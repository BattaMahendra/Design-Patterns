*Structural design pattern is a blueprint of how different objects and classes are 
*combined together to form a bigger structure for achieving multiple goals altogether.
* The patterns in structural designs show how unique pieces of a system can be combined
* together in an extensible and flexible manner. 
* So, with the help structural design pattern we can target and change
