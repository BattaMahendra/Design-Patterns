 * Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.*/

 *
 * Why this violates DIP
 * PaymentProcessor cannot work with CashPayment or UpiPayment without code changes.
 * High-level module controls the creation of its dependency instead of receiving an abstraction.*/
