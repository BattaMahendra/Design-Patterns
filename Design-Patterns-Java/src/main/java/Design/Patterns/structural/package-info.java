/**
*Structural design pattern is a blueprint of how different objects and classes are 
*combined together to form a bigger structure for achieving multiple goals altogether.
 *
* The patterns in Design.Patterns.structural designs show how unique pieces of a system can be combined
* together in an extensible and flexible manner.
 *
* So, with the help Design.Patterns.structural design pattern we can target and change
* a specific parts of the structure without changing the entire structure.
