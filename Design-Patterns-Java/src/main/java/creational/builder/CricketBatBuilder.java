/**
 * Builder design pattern is used to separate the instantiation of product from client code
 * Builder class takes care of the instantiation logic.
 *
 * Builder design pattern is used when an object has too many fields
 * 1. It avoids telescopic constructor problems if the product have too many fields
 * 2. For better readability and simplicity for client when product is being created
 * 3. If we are not using builder pattern and instantiating object by normal constructor call
 * 	  then the client has to use constructor and if by chance product has too many fields then client
 * 	  has to take care of all the fields
 *
 * 	Disadvantages
 * 	If the client needs to manually set each field, there is no automation.
